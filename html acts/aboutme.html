   <p style="color:#3498DB">Good day! My name is John Louie S. Tiongson, 23 years of age and I am a first year student at University of Bohol 
   studying to graduate in the course Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I was born in Mandaue, Cebu and now live in 
   Dampas District, Tagbiliran City, Bohol together with my parents and sister."</p>
   
   <p style="color:#F1C40F">My guiding principle in life is “Believe you can achieve your goals”. It is because I think that in order to achieve 
   the level of success that we desire, first we have to believe that it’s possible to achieve our goals.</p>
   
   <p style="color:#1ABC9C">Talking about accomplishments, although I did not accomplish much, I consider graduating in Senior High last year 
   my greatest achievement. It’s because Senior High for me last year was a wall I have to break through especially because I’ve failed 
   many times not only in grades but also failed my parents by making wrong decisions in life, then after several wasted years and tuition fees, 
   finally I’ve broke through and graduated.</p>
   
   <p style="color:#F39C12">I’m very lacking as of now, but I dream to become a successful Programmer. So to achieve that dream, I plan to reflect
   from my failures and study hard in my course and learn a lot of new things from it.</p>
